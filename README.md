# LD33 Entry
My entry for LD33. Written in Clojurescript using phaser.io

## Play
You can find the original Ludum Dare version on its page [here](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&uid=38813).

The final version is available [here](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&uid=38813).

## Use
Just go ahead and `lein figwheel`! When the server has started connect to `localhost:3449` to try the game.

* the `master` branch is the code for the original LD entry version.
* the `post-compo` branch is the code for the final version.
